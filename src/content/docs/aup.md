The following is **IX.CM's Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP")**. By using IX.CM's Hosting Services ("Services"), you agree to comply with this AUP. You also agree to require your end users to comply with this AUP.

IX.CM reserves the right to amend this AUP at any time, with or without notice to you. IX.CM agrees to post any changes to this AUP on the IX.CM Homepage (located at: https://ix.cm/) and you agree to periodically review this AUP as modified from time to time.

Pursuant to your Hosting Services Agreement, IX.CM may, at its sole discretion, immediately terminate your access to the Services if your conduct violates (or appears to violate) the AUP. In addition, IX.CM may, at its sole discretion, immediately terminate your access to the Services if any of your end users violate the AUP.

You may not use the Services (nor will you permit an end user to use the Services) in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or otherwise impair any of the Services offered by IX.CM, or any services offered by a third party, or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of any of our Services.

### 2.2 Disclosure & Content Removal

IX.CM reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as IX.CM deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in IX.CM's sole discretion.

IX.CM does not control or endorse the content, messages, or information found in any Service and, therefore, IX.CM specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Service.

## 3. Resource Limitation

To ensure the stable operation of services and uphold the principle of fair resource usage, IX.CM establishes the following policies governing the use of computing and network resources.

### 3.1 CPU Usage

- In the event any instance uses excessive CPU from activities such as cryptocurrency CPU mining, IX.CM reserves the right to limit the CPU available to your instances in order to maintain a consistent level of performance on all our nodes.
- **All products are guaranteed 50% CPU usage by default unless otherwise stated.**
- When IX.CM has enough and stable virtualization computing resources in the region, and the client instance's operating system or software is not crashed, IX.CM accepts long-term and reasonable high-load usage of computing resources.

> **Note:** If the workload or software behavior causes abnormal or excessive CPU consumption due to inefficient or inappropriate program design, IX.CM may take actions to limit CPU max performance in order to protect overall node performance and service stability.

### 3.2 Load Balancing

- IX.CM will actively balance VM/Node loads to maximize resource allocation, and will only implement CPU limitation measures when short-term resource expansion is not feasible.

### 3.3 Network Restrictions

- IX.CM reserves the right to restrict VM Internet Ports in cases where such activities affect the overall stability of the network.

## 4. Termination / Access Restriction

IX.CM has no obligation to monitor the Services. However, IX.CM reserves the right to review materials posted to a Service and to remove any materials in its sole discretion.

IX.CM reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to any or all Services and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, with or without notice, for violating this AUP.

Your rights and obligations upon termination of any Service are governed by the Hosting Terms of Service. Upon termination of the Service, your right to use the Service immediately ceases. IX.CM shall have no obligation to maintain any content upon termination of the Services.

### 4.1 Enforcement Actions

Depending on the severity of the violation, IX.CM may implement:

| Severity | Action | Duration |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Minor to Moderate | Service suspension or null routing | 7 to 30 days |
