title: Refund and Cancellation Policy
description: Our refund and cancellation policy for hosting services
---

## Service-Based Business Policy

Kvmcloud Network CO., LIMITED provides digital infrastructure services. Unlike physical products, our services are provisioned and consumed in real-time. This policy outlines how refunds and cancellations work in our specific context.

## Monthly Services

For monthly recurring services:

- **Full Refund Period**: You may request a full refund within 48 hours of initial service activation
- **Prorated Refunds**: After the initial 48-hour period, refunds are issued on a prorated basis for any unused full days remaining in your billing cycle
- **Cancellation Notice**: We require 24 hours notice for cancellation of monthly services

## Annual and Long-Term Commitments

For annual or multi-month prepaid services:

- **Initial Grace Period**: Full refund available within 7 days of service activation
- **Early Termination**: If you cancel after the grace period, you will receive a prorated refund based on our standard monthly rate (not the discounted annual rate)
- **Example**: If you paid $100/year ($8.33/month) but our standard monthly rate is $10/month, your refund will be calculated at the $10/month rate

## What's Not Refundable

The following are non-refundable under all circumstances:

- Domain registration fees (we pay these to the registry on your behalf)
- Setup fees for custom configurations
- Any charges incurred for exceeding allocated resources
- IP address justification deposits or fees
- Late payment fees or service reactivation charges
- Third-party licenses or software purchased through us

## How to Cancel

To cancel your service:
1. Log into your client portal
2. Open a support ticket with "Cancellation Request" in the subject line
3. Specify the services you wish to cancel
4. Provide a brief reason for cancellation (optional but helps us improve)

Cancellations must be submitted through our support ticket system. Email, phone, or chat requests will not be considered valid cancellation notices.

## Processing Time

Refunds are processed within 7-10 business days. The refund will be issued to your original payment method. If the original payment method is no longer available, we will contact you to arrange an alternative.

## Service Abuse and Fraud

We reserve the right to deny refunds in cases where:
- Services violate our acceptable use policy
- Fraudulent payment information was used
- Services were used for prohibited activities
- The account shows patterns suggestive of abuse of our refund policy

## Service Issues and Disputes

If you experience technical issues, please open a support ticket first. Most problems can be resolved quickly by our team. Refund requests based on technical issues that were not reported to our support team will not be honored.

## Limitation of Liability

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY**

- Our liability for any single incident is limited to the amount you paid for the service during the month in which the incident occurred
- We are not liable for:
  - Business interruption or loss of revenue
  - Data loss (you are responsible for your own backups)
  - Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
  - Any damages that exceed what you paid us

By using our services, you agree that these limitations are reasonable given the nature of hosting services and the pricing structure we offer.

## Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated from time to time. The version in effect at the time of your purchase will apply to your service agreement. We will notify customers of material changes via email.
